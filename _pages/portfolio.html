<h2>Paper Replication in Python</h2>

<p>This project replicates the first half of the main results from Cengiz, D., Dube, A., Lindner, A., &
Zentler-Munro, D. (2022). Following the authors, I apply machine learning methods to identify the
potencial workers who are actually affected by the minimum wage policy. In contrast to the original
code, which was written in Stata and R, I replicated the study in Python, streamlining all the code
into a single programming language that is both free and open source. </p>
